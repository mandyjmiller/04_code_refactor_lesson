# Challenge Week 01 - Code Refactor Lesson

## Description 

### USER STORY
AS A marketing agency
I WANT a codebase that follows accessibility standards
SO THAT our own site is optimized for search engines

### Acceptance Criteria
Your website must meet accessibility standards. You can achieve this completing the following:

Semantic HTML elements can be found throughout the source code

HTML elements follow a logical structure independent of styling and positioning

Image and icon elements contain accessible alt attributes

Heading attributes fall in sequential order

Title elements contain a concise, descriptive title

I've refactored the HTML and CSS to address these requirements, committed to GitHub and deployed to Git Pages


## Installation

No particular installation requirements. Web page can be viewed using Chrome, Firefox, Safari or most other standard browser


## Usage 

Provide instructions and examples for use. Include screenshots as needed. 

To add a screenshot, create an `assets/images` folder in your repository and upload your screenshot to it. Then, using the relative filepath, add it to your README using the following syntax:

```md
![screenshot](assets/images/screenshot.png)
```
